              <p className="mb-6">
                A 200-bed community hospital experienced a ransomware attack that encrypted their EHR system and several
                connected clinical applications. The hospital had implemented many of the protective measures described
                in this article, which significantly improved their recovery outcome.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6">
                <strong>Key factors in their successful recovery:</strong>
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
                <li>Immutable backups allowed complete restoration of EHR data without paying the ransom</li>
                <li>
                  Network segmentation contained the attack to specific systems, preventing hospital-wide encryption
                </li>
                <li>Well-practiced downtime procedures enabled continued patient care during the recovery process</li>
                <li>A detailed incident response plan guided the organization through each recovery phase</li>
                <li>Regular restoration testing ensured the recovery process worked as expected</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mb-6">
                While the hospital still experienced 36 hours of EHR downtime, they avoided paying the $3.2 million
                ransom demand and successfully restored all systems with minimal data loss. Their preparation reduced
                what could have been weeks of disruption to less than two days.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
