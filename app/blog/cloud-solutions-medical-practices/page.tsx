              <p className="mb-6">A successful cloud migration requires careful planning and execution:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
                <li>
                  <strong>Assessment:</strong> Evaluate your current IT environment, workflows, and requirements before
                  selecting cloud solutions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Prioritization:</strong> Identify which systems and data to migrate first based on value,
                  complexity, and risk.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Staff training:</strong> Prepare your team for new systems and workflows through comprehensive
                  training.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Testing:</strong> Thoroughly test cloud solutions before full deployment, especially for
                  critical clinical systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Phased implementation:</strong> Consider a gradual approach rather than a "big bang"
                  migration.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Ongoing management:</strong> Develop processes for monitoring, optimizing, and governing your
                  cloud environment.
                </li>
              </ul>

                existing clinical workflows.
